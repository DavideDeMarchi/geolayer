Welcome to geolayer documentation!
==================================

**geolayer** is a Python library for the display of raster and vector datasets on the JRC BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform).

It can be used in the JEO-lab environment (JupyterLab instance) to create notebooks able to display big geo-spatial datasets, or in the creation of Voil√† dashboards using the `vois library <https://https://code.europa.eu/jrc-bdap/vois>`_.

The documentation on the vois library is availble here: `vois library on readthedocs <https://vois.readthedocs.io/>`_
